Guavarita Vice by [@magicrockbrewing](https://instagram.com/magicrockbrewing) and [@collectivebrew](https://instagram.com/collectivebrew) was a sour sensation - as you could imagine based on the ingredients. 

Guava, Lychee, Lime and Thai Basil all combine to give this Berliner Weisse a delicious sweet and sour taste that you might not believe was a beer. This would be a summer hit for sure. 

I can easily imagine drinking this in a beer garden with a BBQ whilst soacking up that summer sun.

Thanks to @mash.ferment.condition.repeat for blessing me with this beauty.

My first @deyabrewery beer and I'm blown away. Into the Haze brought that delightful haze in a delicious IPA package.

Flavours of exotic citrus fruits with a shed load of pine that had an incredible aroma. Didn't want to get to the end of the glass. Definitely want this again!

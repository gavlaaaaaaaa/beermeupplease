Part 2/2 of the Christmas present from @mash.ferment.condition.repeat - this time the DDH DIPA V2 from @cloudwaterbrew 

You gotta admit he nailed it as far as beer gifts go. This was a West Coast DIPA that was big on zest and freshness up front with some delightful pine in the background.

It finished very bitter, begging for another sip!

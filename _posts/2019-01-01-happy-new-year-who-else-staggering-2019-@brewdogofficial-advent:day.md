@brewdogofficial Advent: DAY 21

Albino Squid Assassin by @brewdog is an insane Red Rye IPA 
The beauty with this is that you get the dark, toasted flavours from the malts giving you a nice caramel sweetness and then you get a hit of fruity citrus from the Citra and Chinook hops.

This literally gives you the best of both worlds!

THE OTHER END IS HERE ðŸ˜²

@beerwulfwebshop Advent: DAY 24

This really is the end. Both beer advents gone for another year! Back to hunting down new beers the good old fashioned way.

The final one in the Beerwulf advent was a world beer silver award winner! Bohemian Pilsner by @bellfieldbrewery was a fresh and light pilsner hopped with Saaz. It comes with a slight bitterness and some floral flavours and is an all round classic Czech pils.

Beerwulf, your advent calendar has been insane. Really impressed by the breadth of world beers available! I'll be recommending this in the future for sure!

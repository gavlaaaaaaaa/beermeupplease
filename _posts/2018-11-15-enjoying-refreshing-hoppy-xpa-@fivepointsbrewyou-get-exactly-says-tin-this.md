Enjoying a refreshing and hoppy XPA from [@fivepointsbrew](https://instagram.com/fivepointsbrew).

You get exactly what it says on the tin with this. A citrus pale ale that's hopped with some of my favourites to give it a fresh and grapefruity flavour. 

Had this while at a Nando's in London and felt it went really well with the spicy chicken. Did well to cool the mouth and complement the flavours without being either drowned out or overpowering.

Jolly Cooperation Sour IPA collab from [@hopstuffbrewery](https://instagram.com/hopstuffbrewery) X [@barbarianbrewingidaho](https://instagram.com/barbarianbrewingidaho) 
The [@hopstuffbrewery](https://instagram.com/hopstuffbrewery) team were kind enough to send me over a few cans of their latest beer. I really enjoyed their previous juicy pale ale so was naturally excited for this.

IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT!  At 6.9%  it had a kick of American hops followed by just the amount of sourness to get your mouth watering. Easily enjoyable after a meal to cleanse the pallette .

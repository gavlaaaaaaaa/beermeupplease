Big thanks to [@hopstuffbrewery](https://instagram.com/hopstuffbrewery) for sending me this care package. 

I'll be spending the weekend enjoying these, especially that new #souripa collab with [@barbarianbrewingidaho](https://instagram.com/barbarianbrewingidaho) and some sour sweets.

This was the first care package I've received from a brewery since starting my beer reviews on instagram. My post reviewing their tesco beer was to date my most liked post on instagram so this felt like a nice little bonus :)

Trying the Inhaler Hoppy Pale Ale by [@magicrockbrewing](https://instagram.com/magicrockbrewing) whilst at [@brewdogbristol](https://instagram.com/brewdogbristol) over the weekend!

Magic Rock rarely fail to disappoint and this was no exception. It was fruity and hoppy with some light malt notes and a medium bitterness to finish.

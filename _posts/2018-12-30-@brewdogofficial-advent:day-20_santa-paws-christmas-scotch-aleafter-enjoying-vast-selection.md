@brewdogofficial Advent: DAY 20

Santa Paws, a Christmas scotch ale.

After enjoying the vast selection of Christmas beers available in Sweden it was great to see this pop up to satisfy my craving in the UK.

A malty and dark roasted ale at a sensible abv making it easy to drink whilst keeping the bold dark flavours.

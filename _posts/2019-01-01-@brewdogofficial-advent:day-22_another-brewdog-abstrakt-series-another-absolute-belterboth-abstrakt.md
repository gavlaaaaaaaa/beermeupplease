@brewdogofficial Advent: DAY 22

Another from the Brewdog Abstrakt series and another absolute belter.

Both of the Abstrakt beers I tried were incredible. AB26 was Uncle Duke's Barrel Aged Imperial Stout.

This beer aged 6 months in Bourbon barrels and the flavour really kicks through. You get the usual chocolate and coffee flavours you expect from a stout but with a campfire smokiness to round it all off. Insane üëåüôåüçª

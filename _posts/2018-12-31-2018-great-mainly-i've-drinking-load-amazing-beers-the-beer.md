2018 has been great. Mainly because I've been drinking a load of amazing beers.

The beer journey began in June this year and since then I've grown my account in just 6 months from a personal and rarely used account to one with over 3K followers and have amassed an insane 60K likes ðŸ˜²

Thanks to everyone who has enjoyed my beer posts in 2018 and the breweries that have shown me some love. I'm ready to elevate my game up a few levels in 2019 so stay tuned! 

Happy new year! ðŸŽ†

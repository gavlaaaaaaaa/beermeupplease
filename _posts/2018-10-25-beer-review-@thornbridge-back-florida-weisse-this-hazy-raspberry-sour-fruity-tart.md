[@thornbridge](https://instagram.com/thornbridge) are back at it again with this Florida Weisse ðŸ‘Œ

This hazy raspberry sour was fruity and tart and had an intense, vibrant colour. It works really well as a palette cleanser after a rich or spicy meal and again is one I would keep in the fridge and continue going back to!

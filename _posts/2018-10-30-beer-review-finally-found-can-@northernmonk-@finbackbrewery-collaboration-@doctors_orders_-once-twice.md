Finally found a can of the [@northernmonk](https://instagram.com/northernmonk) and [@finbackbrewery](https://instagram.com/finbackbrewery) collaboration at [@doctors_orders_](https://instagram.com/doctors_orders_) ðŸ˜Š

Once, Twice, Three times a whale is an incredible DIPA that was hazy and full of hoppy, fruity mango flavours - fully justified the price tag and at 8.2% did well to hide its strength. Really enjoyed this.

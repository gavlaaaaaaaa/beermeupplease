Hands up if you've tried this fiery number ðŸ™Œ would love to know what you thought!? [@wanderbeyondbrewing](https://instagram.com/wanderbeyondbrewing) Mexican Cake Imperial Stout was something very unique. 

It poured almost like treacle - really thick and shiny with an ABV of 11% ðŸ˜®. The taste was also next level, it was a solid, strong, wintery stout but with an added kick of spice in the background giving it a chilli heat kinda feeling. Delicious!

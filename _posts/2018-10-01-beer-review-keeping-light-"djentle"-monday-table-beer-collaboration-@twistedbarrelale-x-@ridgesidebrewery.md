Keeping it light and "Djentle" on a Monday with this table beer collaboration from [@twistedbarrelale](https://instagram.com/twistedbarrelale) X [@ridgesidebrewery](https://instagram.com/ridgesidebrewery) 

It was fizzy, with a big mango smell, a light malty taste and a hoppy background - all coming in at 2.7% ABV.

Perfect light session IPA that still packed big flavours just in a lighter package. Great for weekday drinks or a big session.

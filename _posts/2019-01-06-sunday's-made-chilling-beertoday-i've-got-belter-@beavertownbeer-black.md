Sunday's are made for chilling with a beer.

Today I've got a belter from @beavertownbeer - Black Betty black IPA

Yes you read that right, an IPA that's black! This has all the bold flavours of a citrus IPA with punchy west coast hops but with a maltiness coming through after. Clean and not too much bitterness - tasty!

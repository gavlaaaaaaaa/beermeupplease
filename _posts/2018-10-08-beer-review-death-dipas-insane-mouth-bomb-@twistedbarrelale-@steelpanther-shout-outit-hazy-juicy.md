Death to all but DIPAs was an insane mouth bomb by [@twistedbarrelale](https://instagram.com/twistedbarrelale) with a [@steelpanther](https://instagram.com/steelpanther) shout-out!

It was a hazy and juicy double IPA with huge grapefruit flavours and a background kick of fruitiness. Really enjoyed this one and it hid the 8% ABV well.

The thick and hazy nature of it made it feel luxurious and the hops allowed it to taste just as good as it looked.

Latest mini haul from  [@thecheeseginandalebarn](https://instagram.com/thecheeseginandalebarn) this weekend.

Picked up some pales from [@electricbearbrewing](https://instagram.com/electricbearbrewing), Arbor and [@wildcardbrewery](https://instagram.com/wildcardbrewery) and a Mexican cake Imperial stout from [@wanderbeyondbrewing](https://instagram.com/wanderbeyondbrewing) - reviews coming soon.

The cheese gin and ale barn has been a saviour in Lichfield as craft beer shops are sparse. This cute little shop that is literally on my door step keeps bringing new and interesting beers to the table!

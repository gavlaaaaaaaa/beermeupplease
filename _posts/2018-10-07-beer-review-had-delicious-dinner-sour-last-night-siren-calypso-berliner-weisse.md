Had a delicious after dinner sour last night. Siren Calypso Berliner Weisse by [@sirencraftbrew](https://instagram.com/sirencraftbrew) was light and refreshing with a super sour after taste.

It really quenches a thirst and was the first sour beer I tasted> It sparked my love for the berliner weisse style making me the big fan I am of sour beers today.

I had it as a great pallette cleanser after buffalo chicken at [@brewhouse_and_kitchen](https://instagram.com/brewhouse_and_kitchen)

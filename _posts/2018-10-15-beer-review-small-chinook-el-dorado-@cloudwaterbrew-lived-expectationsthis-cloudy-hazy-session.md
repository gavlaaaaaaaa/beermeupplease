Small Chinook El Dorado by [@cloudwaterbrew](https://instagram.com/cloudwaterbrew) lived up to expectations.

This cloudy and hazy session IPA had all the solid attributes for an easy drinking IPA that was flavourful and refreshing. Low ABV at 2.9% and another one that would be a hit in the summer due to it's light and freshness.

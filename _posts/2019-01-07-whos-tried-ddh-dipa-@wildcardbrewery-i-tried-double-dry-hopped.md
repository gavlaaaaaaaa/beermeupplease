Whoâ€™s tried this DDH DIPA from @wildcardbrewery ?

I tried their double dry hopped east coast IPA a while back and although enjoyable I thought it promised more. Well they saved that extra punch for this DDH!

The Mosaic and Citra hops giving their trademark grapefruit and mango flavours and a smell of citrus. Easy to drink although at 8.1% you might want to proceed with caution

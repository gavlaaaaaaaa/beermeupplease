THE END IS HERE ðŸ˜²

@brewdogofficial Advent:DAY 24

The last day of the BrewDog beer advent and boy did they save something special! 

Paradox Uncle Duke's is a whiskey cask aged Imperial Stout weighing in at 13.2% and even comes in a whiskey style box.

Uncle Duke's whiskey is a scotch and bourbon mashup and it's barrel has passed on flavours of coffee, berry and a distinctive smokiness to live alongside the rich malty flavour of the beer. Incredible!

BrewDog it's been a blast and an absolutely cracking, beer filled holidays - cheers to the next one.

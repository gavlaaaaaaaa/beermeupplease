Woohoooo DAMN SON! [@magicrockbrewing](https://instagram.com/magicrockbrewing) killing it again with this Damson Sour IPA collab with [@hawksheadbrewery](https://instagram.com/hawksheadbrewery) üòç

It looked super hazy and had a tart taste that wasn't over sour, with a slight sweetness before a hoppy punch to round it all off. Delicious!

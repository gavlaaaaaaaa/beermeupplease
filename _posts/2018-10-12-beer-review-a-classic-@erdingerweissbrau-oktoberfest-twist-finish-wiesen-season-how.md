A classic [@erdinger.weissbrau](https://instagram.com/erdinger.weissbrau) with an Oktoberfest twist to finish of the Wiesen season.

After previously living in Munich for a year I was lucky enough to enjoy a whole bunch of beer festivals including Oktoberfest. The german beers are so clean and professional and this weissbier is no exception. I can easily be taken back to my time in Bavaria with just one sip of this beer.

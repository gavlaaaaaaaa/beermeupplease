Double Orange and Ginger Oatmeal Stout - "El Gingero" from [@magicrockbrewing](https://instagram.com/magicrockbrewing) 

This collab with [@atgbrewery](https://instagram.com/atgbrewery) resulted in a super smooth stout that was spicy but with an added freshness from the orange. Haven't had a stout for a while and this has rejuvenated the love.

Perfect in the small can as it was rich and spicy so only needed small dose.

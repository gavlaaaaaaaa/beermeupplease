Werrrd! American pale ale by [@electricbearbrewing](https://instagram.com/electricbearbrewing) 
A delicious APA that comes with all the best west coast flavours making this floral and hoppy with grapefruit flavours.

It was light to drink and a real fizz bomb (check out that head üòç). I'll definitely be sampling more from Electric Bear in the future.

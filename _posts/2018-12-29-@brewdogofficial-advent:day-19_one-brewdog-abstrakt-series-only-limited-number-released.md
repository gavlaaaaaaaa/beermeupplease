@brewdogofficial Advent: DAY 19


One from the Brewdog Abstrakt series. Only a limited number of these are released every year so it was a pleasant surprise to find one in this year's advent.

AB24 was a coffee and brown sugar porter that was absolutely delightful. As a coffee lover (@melbourneinlichfield) this hit all the dark rich notes of coffee with a slight sweetness to help give it some life. 
A perfect after dinner drink even at 12% üôåüçªüëå

Quench Quake from [@brewdogofficial](https://instagram.com/brewdogofficial) was a Grapefruit and Tangerine sour

This has a rather unique, dry fizz that quenches your thirst with a sour kick that ended with a sweetness to round it all off. Definite worth a try!

It smelled a little like champaigne or prosecco but with a hint of citrus which was pleasant with the sweet aftertaste.

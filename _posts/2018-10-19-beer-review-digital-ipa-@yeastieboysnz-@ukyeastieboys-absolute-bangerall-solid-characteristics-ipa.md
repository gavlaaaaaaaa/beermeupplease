Digital IPA from [@yeastieboysnz](https://instagram.com/yeastieboysnz) / [@ukyeastieboys](https://instagram.com/ukyeastieboys) is an absolute banger.

All the solid characteristics of an IPA rolled into this easily drinkable package. Mango and grapefruit flavours with a blast of hops - winner winner IPA dinner.

Again this is something you could return to as a classic fridge staple. If you're not sure want to drink and don't want the hassle of making your mind up, this is something you could just grab and enjoy.

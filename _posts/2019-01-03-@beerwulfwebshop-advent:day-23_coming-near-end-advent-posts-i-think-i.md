@beerwulfwebshop Advent: DAY 23

Coming very near to the end of the advent posts. I think I did well to catch up over Christmas although let's face it, it wasn't that hard!

Ninkasi Ambree by @ninkasibrewing was a pale ale that was dry and bitter but had an extra sweetness I wasn't expecting alongside the hoppiness. 
Decent mix of flavours and an easy pale ale.

@beerwulfwebshop Advent: DAY 20

Nearing the end of the beer advents. This traditional Belgian abbey beer by @cornelissenbrewery was malty with a slight nutty and sweetness, again with a bit of winter spice in the background.

It's brewed with Munich malts and Saaz hops and was pleasant to drink at 7% abv.

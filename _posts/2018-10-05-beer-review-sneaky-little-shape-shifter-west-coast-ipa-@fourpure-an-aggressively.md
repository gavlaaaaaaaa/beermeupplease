Sneaky little Shape Shifter West Coast IPA by [@fourpure](https://instagram.com/fourpure) 
An aggressively hopped IPA punching big mango and pineapple flavours ending with a grapefruit bitterness. It's piney and fruity and gives you everything you expect from an AIPA. It hides it's 5.9% ABV well making it very easy to drink.

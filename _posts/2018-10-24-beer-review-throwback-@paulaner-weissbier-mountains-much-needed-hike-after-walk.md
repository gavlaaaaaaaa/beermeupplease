Throwback to this [@paulaner](https://instagram.com/paulaner) Weissbier in the mountains that was much needed after a hike 🗻 😍

After a walk around [@garmischpartenkirchen](https://instagram.com/garmischpartenkirchen) we stumbled upon this bar with a perfect view. Can you think of a better way to enjoy a beer?

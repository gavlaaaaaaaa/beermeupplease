When a glass sums up your existence ðŸ˜‚

Enjoying a pint or two of [@camdentownbrewery](https://instagram.com/camdentownbrewery) pale ale yesterday whilst in Bristol.

We were out with friends and were introduced to The Hobgoblin which serves some delciously dirty food and a few good beers on tap. Ended up eating their 'Cow and Chicken' burger which was a beef burger and chicken burger combo - insanely large and calorific but delicious nonetheless.

The second from @aegir.bryggeri - this time I've got their Little Bro Session IPA.

Bitter fruit aromas of grapefruit and orange peel paired with similar flavours. Slightly bitter and a long lasting finish of grapefruit flavours. 

Easy to drink and overall very pleasant. Impressed with both from this brewery.

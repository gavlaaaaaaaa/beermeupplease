Something a little special. I picked this up as a Christmas present for my dad as a gift set from @beerbohmlichfield 

It goes without saying he loved it and I did too. This was real Belgian beer at its finest. Its fermented twice and the second fermentation includes wine yeast!

It tastes of sweet malts and caramel with some background spice of clove. Very boozy at 10.5% so one to put you asleep on a Sunday evening after a big dinner.

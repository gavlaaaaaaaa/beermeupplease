A day at the Lichfield #oktoberfest bringing a bit of Bavaria to the UK.

Enjoying a stein of [@veltins](https://instagram.com/veltins) with some live music and comedians.

This was the first time I visited the Lichfield Oktoberfest and is something I can see myself doing every year.

The day started with some beers whilst enjoying a variety of comedians. A perfect way to get the drinks flowing and to ensure you're having a good time.

Once you're warmed up, the music starts and gets you stading on the benches in true Oktoberfest fashion whilst you sing along and try not to spill your beer everywhere.

Thoroughly enjoyed it, great day out.

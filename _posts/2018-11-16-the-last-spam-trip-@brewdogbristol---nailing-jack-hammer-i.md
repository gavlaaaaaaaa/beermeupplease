The last of the spam from my trip to [@brewdogbristol](https://instagram.com/brewdogbristol) - nailing a Jack Hammer because I like a bit of strength in my IPA.

This just hits you with grapefruit, then again and when you're not looking, for good measure it gives you one last smack. Classic, big [@brewdogofficial](https://instagram.com/brewdogofficial) flavour with a dry finish - delicious!

A winter special today delivered all the way from Munich. SchneeWeisse is from @erdinger.weissbrau and is a winter version of their classic Weissbier.

It's slightly stronger and darker than their usual for an added winter warmth. There's less of the usual banana flavour as it's replaced with a more refreshing "eating snow" kinda feel.

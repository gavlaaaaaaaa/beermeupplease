This collab between [@eviltwinbrewing](https://instagram.com/eviltwinbrewing) and [@7venthsun](https://instagram.com/7venthsun) was a delightfully fresh and vibrant session IPA.

Rammed full of hops with a fresh lemon and slightly fruity background. Another easy drinker made better by the new #teku glass by [@brewdogofficial](https://instagram.com/brewdogofficial) üôåüëåüçª

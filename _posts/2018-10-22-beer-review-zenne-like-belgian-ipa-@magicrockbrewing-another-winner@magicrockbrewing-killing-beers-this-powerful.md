Zenne-Like Belgian IPA from [@magicrockbrewing](https://instagram.com/magicrockbrewing) is another winner.

[@magicrockbrewing](https://instagram.com/magicrockbrewing) are killing it with these beers 🙌

This was a powerful IPA with sour citrus flavours but also some heavy caramel malts giving it that traditional ale feel. Fairly intense but delicious 👌🍻🙌

This is my second beer from @wanderbeyondbrewing and they've nailed it again. This Milkshake IPA is a 3% ABV version of their popular milkshake IPA. It was fizzy but smooth to drink and had a background flavour of vanilla. 

I had this with a curry and it went really well due to the creamy lactose cooling down the spice and the fizziness to quench the thirst.

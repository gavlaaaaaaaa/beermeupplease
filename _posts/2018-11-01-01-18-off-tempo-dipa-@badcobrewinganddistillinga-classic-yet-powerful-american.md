01 18 Off Tempo DIPA by [@badcobrewinganddistilling](https://instagram.com/badcobrewinganddistilling)

A classic yet powerful American DIPA that was rammed with flavours of grapefruit and pineapple. Solid grab from [@asda](https://instagram.com/asda) - shot by [@bradone_](https://instagram.com/bradone_)
